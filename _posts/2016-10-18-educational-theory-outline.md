In order to understand the theory behind how children learn, I need to delve
deeper in to the work of several instrumental educational theorists. Largely focusing on discovery
learning, which is the main theory behind visual programming languages such as Scratch.

So here we go, the main men and their theories that will be the topic of future posts:

- Lev Vygotsky
    - Social cognition
- Jerome Bruner (and David Wood)
    - Scaffolding
- Jean Paiget
    - Stages of cognitive development (constructivism)
- Seymour Papert
    - Constructionism vs Instructionism
