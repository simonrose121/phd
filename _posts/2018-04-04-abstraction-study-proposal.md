**Pre-test** (w/c 21st May)

The pre-test aims to evaluate abstraction techniques in Scratch and more generally in computational thinking.

*Scratch assessment*

Participants are given 1 hour to create an animation in Scratch from a specification. The project will involve navigating a map and 'dropping' sprites in certain locations (they will be given a starting project with backgrounds and sprites). For example:

    'When the green flag is pressed, animate the catâ€™s movement around the edge of the park, planting a tree in each corner'

This task allows participants to create simple solutions with duplicated blocks and long scripts, but then recognise duplication and use multiple sprites, custom blocks and clones to solve these.

These projects will be analysed using Dr Scratch, giving each participant a score for abstraction and decomposition. These scores are given as follows:  

1 point: More than one script and more than one sprite ([example](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/173252125/#editor))  
2 points: Use of custom blocks ([example](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/173252164/#editor))  
3 points: Use of clones (instances of sprites) ([example](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/173252053/#editor))

Possible issues:  
- Participants with no Scratch experience give up quickly - in this case they would need another task to do, like mathletics?  
- Lacks sensitivity because there are only 4 possible scores available.

Other ideas:   
- The project contains existing blocks and the participant is asked to extend it? - assessment ideas from [here.](http://scratched.gse.harvard.edu/ct/assessing.html)
This would also help participants who have no previous understanding of Scratch.

*Computational thinking assessment*  

Participants will then complete a paper or tablet-based computational thinking test. The [Computational Thinking test](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Marcos_Roman-Gonzalez/publication/318469859_Complementary_Tools_for_Computational_Thinking_Assessment/links/596cee18a6fdcc920023b978/Complementary-Tools-for-Computational-Thinking-Assessment.pdf) measures abstraction and has been used with children aged 10-11 in a [previous study](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Marcos_Roman-Gonzalez/publication/320884563_Development_of_Computational_Thinking_Skills_through_Unplugged_Activities_in_Primary_School/links/5a51f116aca2725638c5ed76/Development-of-Computational-Thinking-Skills-through-Unplugged-Activities-in-Primary-School.pdf).

***(half term w/c 28th May)***

**Intervention** (w/c 4th June - 13th July)

Participants will be split into three groups:

1 Pirate Plunder - debugging (existing program instructions) 

![Debugging]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pp-debugging.PNG) 

2 Pirate Plunder - non-debugging (empty programs)

![No Debugging]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pp-nondebugging.png)  

3 Twinkl Scratch curriculum - control

Note: The school have asked for class groups to be maintained. So the Pirate Plunder versions will be randomised within two classes and the third class will be the control.

The intervention will last a maximum of 6 weeks and take place during their timetabled IT slot. Y6 are given a morning in the IT suite that is divided into two 50 minute slots and 1 hour slot. *Will see if all slots can be made even.*

Possible issues:  
- The Scratch curriculum reduces the chance of getting a result.
- The game content doesn't last, or is too long for the 6 week period. Participants may finish the game early.

**Post-test** (w/c 16th July)

The post test will be conducted 8 weeks after the pre-test.

*Scratch assessment*

Participants will create another Scratch project to a similar specification than the first.

*Computational thinking assessment*

Participants will redo the computational thinking assessment.

*Artifact-based interviews*

Selected participants will be asked why they have used certain blocks. This should give an idea of whether they've understood why they should use them, or they've simply been taught how to.

Hypotheses
=

Participants playing Pirate Plunder will improve on the Scratch assessment from pre to post-test compared to the control.

Participants playing the debugging version of Pirate Plunder will progress faster and improve on the Scratch assessment more than the non-debugging version from pre to post-test.

Participants playing Pirate Plunder will have understood why they should use abstraction techniques, and will be able to demonstrate this in artifact-based interviews.

Scores on the Computational Thinking test will improve from pre to post-test for both the Pirate Plunder and the control groups.
