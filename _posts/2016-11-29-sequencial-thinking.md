The national curriculum for Computing in UK primary schools states that at KS1 (5-7 years old) pupils should be taught to:

- understand what algorithms are; how they are implemented as programs on digital devices; and that programs execute by following precise and unambiguous instructions
- create and debug simple programs
- use logical reasoning to predict the behaviour of simple programs

If I summarise the research I did on computational thinking, it is broadly defined as these high level skills (note: often not even requiring a computer):

- Procedures and algorithms (sequential thinking)
- Decomposing problems
- Abstraction
- Data representation
- Parallelism
- Debugging

It is clear that the national curriculum focuses on procedures and algorithms for children of this age. One would assume this is because children are not developed enough to understand some of the more complicated aspects of computational thinking. They may lack the working memory to store and apply information to different contexts (abstraction), or different parts of the problem they are given (decomposition). Therefore, the concentration (for the time being) will be on sequential thinking; predicting the outcome of sequences and organising things in to a sequential order.

 Sequential thinking is covered in the KS1 maths curriculum under the measurement section as "sequencing of events in chronological order", and in the reading section as "discussing the sequence of events in books and how items of information are
related". Sequencing activities are defined in curriculums worldwide in both the language and mathematics sections, and are referred to as a child's "mathematical building blocks" (Kazakoff, Sullivan and Bers 2013, p247). This includes activities such as:

 - Retelling a story in a logical sequence
 - Ordering numbers
 - Understanding the sequence of a day's activities

Most programming games suitable for young children (such as Lightbot, Kodable, etc) are based on providing a sequence of instructions for a robot (or other object) to perform. Researches have provided frameworks to measure the ability of these games to develop computational thinking (e.g. Gouws, Bradshaw and Wentworth 2013). It would be interesting to see if these games can develop sequential thinking skills in young children.

**The Effect of a Classroom-Based Intensive Robotics and Programming Workshop on Sequencing Ability in Early Childhood**

A study along these lines was carried out by Kazakoff, Sullivan and Bers. They identified in a previous study that programming robots may have an impact on sequencing skills (Kazakoff and Bers 2011). However this earlier study found the difference after using programmable robots over a few months. For this study, 27 early years children (aged  4 and 5) used educational robotic kits with a block-based programming language called CHERP on a week intensive course.  At the end of the week, family and friends were invited to see what the children had been working on. This external motivator may have had an impact on children's ability to focus on the task.

*Sequencing Assessment*

The sequencing assessment used in the pre-test and post-test was derived from Baron-Cohen et al (1986). Who as part of a study to test levels of understanding of autistic children created a battery of 15 picture stories. These stories are made up of cards, 4 cards per story, and were created for the appropriate age level. This assessment was chosen because of the similarities between programming a robot and telling a story that involves steps (which is highlighted in the curricula above). The stories are split in to 5 categories:

- Mechanical 1 (action with object)
- Mechanical 2 (action with person and an object)
- Behavioural 1 (routines involving the self)
- Behavioural 2 (social routines involving others)
- Intentional (theory of mind)

*Results*

The study found a significant effect between the pre-test and post-test scores of both pre-kindergarten and kindergarten children. Compared to the control group which showed no difference.

*Limitations*

The only obvious limitation of this study in the sample size. The authors state that they only had 27 participants because of parental permission slips not being returned, and a limited time frame in which to conduct the pre and post-test data.

**Conclusion**

The idea that sequencing is an essential part of developing cognitive ability in children of this age is backed up by it's appearance in multiple subject curricula. It would be interesting to recreate this study using Lightbot (or a similar game) instead of CHERP and robotics kits. Results from this could hopefully open up more opportunities for future research.
