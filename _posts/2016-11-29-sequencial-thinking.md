The national curriculum for Computing in UK primary schools states that at KS1 (5-7 years old) pupils should be taught to:

- understand what algorithms are; how they are implemented as programs on digital devices; and that programs execute by following precise and unambiguous instructions
- create and debug simple programs
- use logical reasoning to predict the behaviour of simple programs

If I summarise the research I did on computational thinking, it is broadly defined as these high level skills (note: often not even requiring a computer):

- Procedures and algorithms (sequential thinking)
- Decomposing problems
- Abstraction
- Data representation
- Paralellism
- Debugging

It is clear that the national curriculum focuses on procedures and algorithms for children of this age. One would assume this is because children are not developed enough to understand some of the more complicated aspects of computational thinking. They may lack the working memory to store and apply information to different contexts (abstraction), or different parts of the problem they are given (decomposition). Therefore, the concentration (for the time being) will be on sequential thinking; predicting the outcome of sequences and organising things in to a sequential order.

 Sequential thinking is covered in the KS1 maths curriculum under the measurement section as "sequencing of events in chronological order", and in the reading section as "discussing the sequence of events in books and how items of information are
related". Sequencing activities are defined in curriculums worldwide in both the language and mathematics sections, and are referred to as a child's "mathematical building blocks" (Kazakoff, Sullivan and Bers 2013, p247). This includes activities such as:

 - Retelling a story in a logical sequence
 - Ordering numbers
 - Understanding the sequence of a day's activities

Most programming games suitable for young children (such as Lightbot, Kodable, etc) are based on providing a sequence of instructions for a robot (or other object) to perform. Researches have provided frameworks to measure the ability of these games to develop computational thinking (e.g. Gouws, Bradshaw and Wentworth 2013). It would be interesting to see if these games can develop sequential thinking skills in young children.

A study along these lines was carried out by Kazakoff, Sullivan and Bers
