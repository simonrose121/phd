Lightbot is an educational game that teaches programming concepts. The goal is to give a robot commands that will enable it to navigate a maze and turn on all lights in a level.

Lightbot was also used as part of the Hour of Code initiative.

**Key Features**

- 9 years+
- Game-based learning
	- Lightbot is a major exponent of game-based learning, where learning takes place in a gaming context
- Programming concepts
	- Lightbot introduces fairly complex programming concepts in a manor that is integrated with the gameplay:
		- Procedures
			- Some levels may have 1 or 2 procedure programs in addition to the main program.
		- Loops
			- These procedures can be called recusively (thus forming a loop).
		- Overloading
			- The robot will perform different actions depending on where it is standing.
			- This is done using elevators or teleport boxes.
		- Conditionals
			- Lightbot introduces conditionals by changing the colour of the robot when lighting up certain lights.
			- When the robot is coloured, it will perform instructions of that colour in the program.

	- The scripting space is limited so that players have to refine their programs, stars are also rewarded for programs that contain the least possible amount of instructions.

- 4-8 years
- Simplified concepts (differences from Lightbot)
	- No stars for optimised level completion.
	- Slower introduction of programming concepts.
		- Jumping is introduced as a seperate concept.
