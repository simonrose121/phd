![Scratch Environment]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/scratch.jpg){:width="500px"}

Scratch is a constructionist visual programming environment inspired by Seymour Papert's Logo (being inspired by Papert seems to be a common theme!) It was developed at MIT Media Lab by the Lifelong Kindergarten Group.

It can be used to create anything from short stories to complex games.

**Based on**

*Logo, Smalltalk, constructionism*

**Key features**

- Block-based programming
	- Arguably the first use of block-based programming (which has since inspired many more applications that use this approach) inspired by Lego.
	- Lack of syntax (differing from logo) means that syntax errors are eliminated.
	- Contains most basic programming principles (data types, conditionals, sequencing, etc).
	- Blocks are grouped in to different categories:
		- Motion
		- Looks
		- Sound
		- Pen
		- Data
		- Events
		- Control
		- Sensing
		- Operators
		- More Blocks (external devices)
	- This allows for "tinkerability" and bricolage programming (a bottom-up approach).
	- Also fits Seymour Papert's ideal of "low floor high ceiling" learning.
- Immediate feedback
	- Similar to logo, scratch will perform the action of any block that is pressed providing immediate feedback.
- Customisation & Creativity
	- Users can import their own images in to Scratch.
	- It allows for an endless range of possible creations, thus strengthening creativity.
	- Animation system.
- Extensibility
	- Fits Papert's low-floor high-ceiling learning principles.
- Community (objects-to-share-with)
	- Scratch has a vibrant community in which users can share their work at the click of a button.
- Remixing
	- Scratch allows users to "remix" others work, which simply speaking creates a copy and allows them to edit (or remix) it however they want.

**Criticism**

- Lack of debugging ability
	- Scratch runs all it's instructions concurrently, so debugging it particularly difficult (no step-by-step breakpoints). *possible weakness against KS1 curriculum
- Enforcement of "bad" programming habits (bricolage against top-down approaches taught in traditional computer science courses).

**Use in education**

- Widely used in education to teach programming principles (in varying ages, 6-18!).
- Sometimes taught using a set curriculum (instructionism and not constructionism).
