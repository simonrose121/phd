Connected Code is written by Yasmin Kafai and Quinn Burke, both are advocates of programming in education and constructionist learning.

**Computational participation**

- Papert's constructionist learning
- Programming in education
	- Introduced in to UK and some other curriculum but not US
- Open source movement
	- "created, used, repurposed and shared"
- Computers as a tutor, tool and tutee (making the transition to the child programming the computer)

**Objects-to-share-with**

- Instead of objects-to-think-with (learning is a social process)
- Creating personal knowledge

**Scratch-collaboration**

- Creating meaningful online communities (akin to samba schools)

**Remixing**

- Bricolage (bottom up approach to creating)
- Remix trees (attributing to original creator of work)

**Tangibles**

- Syntonic learning (makey makey boards)
- Lego mindstorms
- Smart textiles
