All good PhD's consist of regularly published work. Coupled with the need for an exploratory study to break open the research area (and hopefully give some useful results), I decided to plan an initial study based on the paper by Kazakoff et al (2013).

This article will have the following structure; a brief recap of research methodologies, an outline of methodologies used by existing studies, possible methodologies for my study, and a justified choice of methodology (to be turned in an application). Research ethics will also need to be considered as applications take a while to be approved.

## Methodoligies
- Overall approach
	- Qualitative
	- Quantitative
	- Mixed methods (mixture of the two)
- Empirical
	- Pre-test post-test
	- Post-test only
	- Pre-test only
- Case study
- Secondary analysis

## Existing Methodologies

I first identified studies in to computational thinking, problem solving, or just general programming (using Scratch etc) where the participants were 8 years old or younger. This currently consists of 14 papers, I will try and add more as I find them.

Type of Paper:
- Journal Article - **11**
- Conference Proceedings - **3**

Overall approach:
- Quantitative - **7**
- Qualitative - **3**
- Mixed methods - **4**

Research design:
- Post-test only - **8**
- Pre-test post-test - **3**
- Iterative - **2**
- Case study - **1**

Most of these studies are testing some form of programming environment on cognitive ability. Which is what I am to do.

## Possible Methodologies

This largely hinges around environmental limitations of how long intervention studies can last in school (and how long I'd want it to last). For example, it is unlikely that I will be able to conduct an intensive week of intervention.
