To start off my PhD, I'm going to conduct an exploratory study (and hopefully get some publishable results).

This article will have the following structure; a brief recap of research methodologies, an outline of methodologies used by existing studies, possible methodologies for my study, and a justified choice of methodology (to be turned in an application). Research ethics will also need to be considered as applications take a while to be approved.

## Methodologies
- Overall approach
	- Qualitative
	- Quantitative
	- Mixed methods (mixture of the two)
- Empirical
	- Pre-test post-test
	- Post-test only
- Case study
- Secondary analysis

## Existing Methodologies

I first identified studies in to computational thinking, problem solving, or just general programming (using Scratch etc) where the participants were 8 years old or younger. It is worth noting that there are a lot more papers who focus on children over this age. This currently consists of 14 papers, I will try and add more as I find them.

Type of Paper:

- Journal Article - **11**
- Conference Proceedings - **3**

Overall approach:

- Quantitative - **7**
- Qualitative - **3**
- Mixed methods - **4**

Research design:

- Post-test only - **8**
- Pre-test post-test - **3**
- Iterative - **2**
- Case study - **1**

Most of these studies are testing some form of programming environment on cognitive ability. Which is what I am to do.

## Possible Methodologies

This largely hinges around environmental limitations of how long intervention studies can last in school (and how long I'd want it to last). For example, it is unlikely that I will be able to conduct an intensive week of intervention, but an after-school club format may be more reasonable.

### Initial Idea

The initial idea for a study is to see if the results of [Kazakoff et al. (2013)]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2016-11-29-sequential-thinking %}) can be recreated using a programming game such as Lightbot.

Ideally this would use a pre-test post-test experimental design.  The assessments would focus on sequential thinking ability (previously this has been done using sequencing story assessments however some alternative could be used).

### Possible Issues

The current ability and experience level of children in using programming tools. Schools who have properly grasped the computing curriculum will be more difficult to find publishable results in because the children will already have the computational skills given by these tools. This could be counteracted by using more than one school to conduct the study, but could be problematic with only one researcher.

If I require the teacher to deliver some form of curriculum then the willingness of her/him will be a vital part of the study. I think the best option would be to deliver some content myself, as part of an after school club. After school clubs are often popular with this kind of activity due to them being able to use computers.

## Study Plan

- Participants
	- Y2 students from 2 different primary schools
		- One with experience using programming tools.
		- One where programming tools are not a key part of the curriculum.
- Mixed methods
	- Quantitative data collected through a problem solving assessment (focus on sequencing ability, need to scale this to be appropriate for the age group picked).
	- Qualitative data in the form of focus groups and/or feedback from students as the intervention is taking place.
- Pre-test post-test design
	- Testing in the form of sequencing assessments.
	- These will need to differ between the pre and post-test, but be similar enough to be comparable.
	- **Need to decide on an assessment**
- Intervention
	- 2 groups
		- One using Lightbot (or Lightbot Jr depending on the environment).
		- One using another game? or another programming tool?
