All good PhD's consist of regularly published work. Coupled with the need for an exploratory study to break open the research area (and hopefully give some useful results), I decided to plan an initial study based on the paper by Kazakoff et al (2013).

This article will have the following structure; a brief recap of research methodologies, an outline of methodologies used by existing studies, possible methodologies for my study, and a justified choice of methodology (to be turned in an application). Research ethics will also need to be considered as applications take a while to be approved.

## Methodoligies
- Overall approach
	- Qualitative
	- Quantitative
	- Mixed methods (mixture of the two)
- Empirical
- Case study
- Secondary analysis
