Discovery Education's coding platform (otherwise known as Espresso Coding) is a programming platform that can be used to teach block-based, HTML and Python.

It is worth noting that this is a commercial product (unlike Scratch, ToonTalk, etc) and therefore has no academic literature published about it.

**Key Features**

- Block-based environment
	- Designer and code are in seperate tabs.
- Computer as tutor, tool and tutee - Robert Taylor
	- Combines all three paradigms.
	- Produces an interesting combination of instructionism and constructionism (depending on context).
- Lessons
	- Individual lessons in line with UK National Curriculum.
	- Split in to age groups.
	- Each lesson comes with a comprehensive lesson plan for teachers.

- Sharing
	- Per school basis (standalone project links can be produced to view projects).
- Challenges and free code lessons
	- Specific challenges (creating games, telling stories or simulating concepts).
	- Free code (similar to Scratch in that it allows users to do whatever they want).
- Coding courses for teachers
	- Discovery Education run training courses (costing a tidy £400 or £600 depending on length).
	- They also provide an online coding camp.
