**Based On**

*Logo, Janus, Actor Model*

**Key Features**

- Concurrency
	- Concurrent constraint language
	- Actor model
- Context
	-
	- The original version of toontalk took place in a city, with individual characters that performed certain actions.
	- In the web version the characters have been kept but the environment simplified:
		- Number (representing values that can be used for arithmetic)
		- Box (storage of items)
		- Birds & Nests (sending messages between nests concurrently!)
		- Scales (comparisons)
		- Sensor (sensing browser events like mouse clicks)
		- Robot (represents rules and computation)
		- Magic wand (duplication)
		- Hoover (removal)
- Self-teaching
	- Suitible for young children and (should) require no prior teaching.
- Animation
- Sprites (similar to Logo's turtle)
