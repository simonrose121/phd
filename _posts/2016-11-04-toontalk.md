**Based On**

*Logo, Janus, Actor Model*

**Key Features**

- Concurrency
	- Concurrent constraint programming
		- Variables specified with constraints (constraint logic programming).
		- Goals are satisfied concurrently using "don't care nondeterminism", only one clause is used.
	- Actor model
		- Actor (thing that recieves a message and does some kind of computation on it).
			- Similar to object oriented objects that recieve a message (method call) and do something depending on the message.
		- Actors never share memory and can maintain a private state.
		- Asynchronous message passing.
		- When an actor recieves a message it can do 3 things:
			- Create more actors (to handle multiple concurrent messages)
			- Send messages to other actors
			- Designate what to do with the next message

- Context
	- The original version of toontalk took place in a city, with individual characters that performed certain actions.
	- In the web version the characters have been kept but the environment simplified:
		- Number (representing values that can be used for arithmetic)
		- Box (storage of items)
		- Birds & Nests (sending messages between nests concurrently!)
			- Bird (channel transmit)
			- Nests (channel receive)
		- Scales (comparisons)
		- Sensor (sensing browser events like mouse clicks)
		- Robot (methods)
		- Magic wand (duplication)
		- Hoover (removal)
	- All state is local to processes (actors).
- Self-teaching
	- Suitible for young children and (should) require no prior teaching.
- Animation
	- One of the fundamental ideas behind ToonTalk is that source code is animated.
	- Aims to use animation as a means of communication.
- Sprites (similar to Logo's turtle)
