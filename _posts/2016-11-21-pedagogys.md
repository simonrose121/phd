Educational programming tools can be used to teach programming in many different ways. These pedagogys usually fall somewhere between two axis; instructionism vs constructionism and individual vs group learning.

Instructionism is the application of epistomological objectivity, in which knowledge is absolute and seperate from the learner. It is teacher focused, product oriented, non-interactive, skill based and highly perscribed. Students are viewed as passive receptors of knowledge. Instructionists claim that this pedagogy is helpful for disadvantaged learners.

In comparison, constructivism (or constructionism) is the application of subjectivity, where knowledge is based on individual experiences and is part of the knower. Constructionism is student focused, students construct their own knowledge based on their pre-existing knowledge structures. The teacher is there simply as a guide for this active knowledge construction. Multiplicity is key part of constructionism, there are multiple representations of reality, none of which are supier to any others.
