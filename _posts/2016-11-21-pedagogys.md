Educational programming tools can be used to teach programming in many different ways. These pedagogys usually fall somewhere between two axis; instructionism vs constructivism and individual vs group learning.

**Instructionism**

Instructionism is the application of epistomological objectivity, in which knowledge is absolute and seperate from the learner. It is teacher focused, product oriented, non-interactive, skill based and highly perscribed. Students are viewed as passive receptors of knowledge. Instructionists claim that this pedagogy is helpful for disadvantaged learners.

**Constructivism**

In comparison, constructivism is the application of subjectivity, where knowledge is based on individual experiences and is part of the knower. Constructivism student focused, students construct their own knowledge based on their pre-existing knowledge structures. The teacher is there simply as a guide for this active knowledge construction. Multiplicity is key part of constructivism, there are multiple representations of reality, none of which are superior to any others.

The differences between these approaches can be defined as *"the position that skill is prerequisite to meaning"* against *"the position that meaning is prerequisite to skill"* (Johnson 2009). They also differ in the way they assess learners. Instructionism is very much result oriented (based on the scientific approach that there is only 1 right answer), whereas constructivism tends to measure learner motivation.

**Individual**

**Group**
