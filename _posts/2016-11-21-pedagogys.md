Educational programming tools can be used to teach programming in many different ways. These pedagogys usually fall somewhere between two axis; instructionism vs constructivism and individual vs collaborative learning.

**Instructionism**

Instructionism is the application of epistomological objectivity, in which knowledge is absolute and seperate from the learner. It is teacher focused, product oriented, non-interactive, skill based and highly perscribed. Students are viewed as passive receptors of knowledge. Instructionists claim that this pedagogy is helpful for disadvantaged learners.

**Constructivism**

In comparison, constructivism is the application of subjectivity, where knowledge is based on individual experiences and is part of the knower. Constructivism is student focused, students construct their own knowledge based on pre-existing knowledge structures. The teacher is there simply as a guide for this active knowledge construction (often discribed as discovery learning). Multiplicity is key part of constructivism, in which there are multiple representations of reality, none of which are superior to any others.

The differences between these approaches can be defined as *"the position that skill is prerequisite to meaning"* against *"the position that meaning is prerequisite to skill"* (Johnson 2009). They also differ in the way they assess learners. Instructionism is very much result oriented (based on the scientific approach that there is only one right answer), whereas constructivism tends to measure learner motivation.

The epistomological reality of knowledge is that it is both subjective and objective. So further questions could focus on whether the integration of these two concepts when teaching using educational programming tools is effective.

**Individual**

When working individually, "students work individually at their own level and rate toward an academic goal"* (Gokhale 1995).

**Collaborative (Group)**

*"An instruction method in which students work in groups toward a common academic goal"* (Gokhale 1995). Cognitive load theory states that humans have both long term and working memory. Children develop their working memory as they get older, and are able to hold more and more information relating to a specific problem in their heads. Collaborative learning can assist in helping learners with weak working memory skills. An idea closely coupled with group cognition and even distributed cognition theory.

### Pedagogical Approaches

Seymour Papert defined constructionism as "learning by making, inventing, doing and creating". Logo and the tools that it inspired, such as Scratch, exemplify this pedagogical approach. However, educational programming tools like this can also be used with other pedagogical approaches. Although Scratch was designed based on constructivist principles, it can (and often is) used with an instructivist pedagogy in education. In a traditional classroom setting (teacher directing the class from the front), students are given set instructions to follow on their individual Scratch programs. Any mistakes are corrected and each program is identical to the next. This approach is also taken by tools such as Espresso Coding and Purple Mash that use the block-based programming of Scratch but supply the content in an instructionist fashion, limiting the student to learning each concept in a structured format. Programs are created in each lesson, and have to be adjusted until they have reached the "correct" solution.

**Further Questions**

Are young children able to learn using a constructionist approach? or do they first require some instruction to learn the basic concepts of programming tools?

Is individual or collaborative learning more effective when using these tools?
