![Logo Example]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/logo_example.png)

Seymour Papert and Wally Freuzeig's turtle logo environment was arguably the first programming language designed specifically for learning. Previously programming had been taught using text-based languages such as LISP or BASIC, which were overly complex for younger children.

Having already read Papert's [Mindstorms]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2016-10-18-mindstorms %}), which describes the reasoning behind Logo, I will try and summarise the key tenets behind the language.

**Based on**

*LISP, constructionism*

**Key Features**

- Turtle (objects-to-think-with)
	- Turtle can be described as "body syntonic" because users can describe the movement of the turtle using their own body.
	- The turtle was a real object which a pencil could be placed in, instructions were then programmed in using on board buttons.
- Immediate feedback
	- Logo gives the user feedback in plain english instead of the mangled syntax of most programming languages (notice it's also from the point of view of the turtle), for example:

`fowad`
**`I don't know how to fowad`**

- Modularity and extensibility
	- Logo supports procedures and variables which can be named and called in a simple syntax (see top of the page for another example)
	- Variables can also be set at a global level for the environment.
	- All this means that logo fits Papert's ideal of "low floor high ceiling" learning.
	- There have been loads of expansions of Logo developed over the years which give complex programming paradigms such as parrallelism and object orientation.

to square :size
repeat 4 [forward :size right 90]
end

square 20{% endhighlight %}
- Dynamic typing and flexible language
	- Logo accepts both strings and numbers as input without the user having to specify.
	- Commands can also be shortened in some versions of the language.

**Use in education**

- Logo was used in schools throughout the 70's and 80's (through initiatives such as Project Headlight) but it's use declined in the 90's (towards the internet boom).
