The aim of this post is to outline some of the current questions surrounding my proposed research study.

#### Ceiling Effect

Wikipedia states that the ceiling effect is "the level at which an independent variable no longer has an effect on a dependent variable." This could become an issue in my study due to the proposed scoring system of the pre and post-tests:

- 2 points for a correct sequence.
- 1 point for the correct ending of the sequence.
- 0 points for an incorrect sequence.

Say the test only has 5 questions (as it did in a previous study I am partially replicating), that means the maximum score is 10 points. If the participants find the test easy on average, and a lot of them get 10, this is the ceiling effect in action as the dependent variable has hit an upper limit which is not affected by the independent variable.

Therefore, it would be useful to change the assessment slightly to get a wider spread of results. This could be done in a few ways:

- Increasing the number of questions (therefore increasing the highest possible score).
- Having a fixed time limit on the assessment, so participants will answer a different amount of questions and therefore increase the spread of results.
- Adjust the scoring system, not entirely sure how this would work at the moment.

#### Validity of Assessment

There are questions about the validity of using questions for an assessment created for an entirely different study. The proposed study uses an assessment created by Baron Cohen, et al., for a study measuring the ability of children with autism to process certain events. As such, there sequences are split into 5 different categories:

- Mechanical 1 (objects interacting causally with each other)
- Mechanical 2 (people and objects acting causally on each other)
- Behavioural 1 (a single person acting out everyday routines)
- Behavioural 2 (people acting in social routines)
- Intentional (people acting in everyday activities requiring the attribution of mental states)

The results of the study were that autistic children struggled to sequence intentional events.

That being said, sequencing stories in this way is written into the Sheffield Scheme of Work for Computing in Primary Schools. It is hoped that materials for these can be sourced, scanned and added to the application.

#### Ability Level

Possibly the biggest unanswered question about the study so far:

**Do the participants have the ability to play the games?**

This can be separated into three different categories:

- Motor ability to use the sequencing assessment (which requires drag and drop).
- Cognitive ability to use the sequencing assessment.
- Cognitive ability to play Lightbot and the other (as yet unchosen) game.

Problems in any of these categories could be catastrophic for the study, so it is important that software and games are tested before the study begins. A visit to another primary school has been organised so hopefully these questions will be answered soon.

#### Groupings

It is hoped that the study will take place in a primary school with around 90 children per year group. This would give a large sample size which would be better for statistical analysis. It is proposed that as many children as possible complete the pre-test in groups of 15 (or half a class). During this process, each child will be assigned an identification number that they will use during the post-test.

#### Intervention

For the intervention, the current plan is the either use Lightbot's flash version, or to load it on to around 30 tablets. However, it will need to be clarified with the school whether this is possible. This will also mean that the other game needs to be tablet based as well.

It is proposed that the intervention will take place in class groups to limit disruption to the curriculum. Due to there being 3 classes, the groups will do the intervention as follows:

1. Playing Lightbot
2. Playing another game (slightly better control)
3. Doing nothing (control)

This is all subject to agreement from the school. Potential issues are:

- Controlling a class group of this size.
- Taking into account tablets that aren't working.
- Possible collaboration, will this matter?

The final question is what the second game will be. It needs to be a game that contains no sequencing but has some educational value so that it can be justified (and children aren't going to school and just playing computer games).
