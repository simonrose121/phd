I've tried to cover tools that are relevant to young children (5-7 years old) whilst analysing a variety of different environments (links can be found [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2016-10-31-programming-tools %}))

Below is a venn diagram that attempts to categorise these tools in to textual, visual and physical categories.

*Games in white, more traditional programming environments in black*

Additionally, several other interesting paradigms can be drawn from these tools:

- Constructionism vs instructionism
- Problem based learning and game based learning
- Rule based (declarative programming)
- Sequential vs concurrent
- Programming by demonstration
- *Appropriateness for younger children?*
