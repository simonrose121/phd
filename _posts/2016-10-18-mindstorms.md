The first stop on our journey is Seymour Papert's seminal work on the use of computers in education,
originally written in 1986 when we were just beginning to see computers in the classroom.

_**Key Points**_

**Children programming computers, not the other way round**  
The child becomes the episotomologist -> learning about learning knowledge.

**Mathophiles**  
Not being taught knowledge correctly so building a mental barrier against it, "I'm not good at maths, etc".

**Environments for learning**  
Bridging the gap between students and teachers (samba schools.)
Embed learning in culture -> there needs to be some cultural context behind learning.

**Mathland**  
Building an environment (virtual or physical) where learning goals are relevant (what Papert tried
to do with Logo)

**Instructism vs constructionism**  
Learning maths without meaning outside of the classroom. Constructionism means learning
through experience in active construction with a strong social context.
