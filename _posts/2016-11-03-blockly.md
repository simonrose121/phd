Blockly is Google's block-based programming language that can used to generate code to other languages including JavaScript, PHP, Python and Dart.

It is a work in progress!

**Based on**

*Scratch*

**Features**

- Block-based programming
	- Programming very similar to Scratch.
	- Blocks are more complex (and more similar to real programming constructs).
	- Blocks are categorised in a similar manor to Scratch:
		- Logic
		- Loops
		- Math
		- Text
		- Lists
		- Color
		- Variables
		- Functions
- Code generation
	- Blockly generates code in to proper text based languages:
		- JavaScript
		- PHP
		- Python
		- Dart
- For developers (extendible)
	- Blockly is open source, so all it's code is available to any developer who wants to extend it.
	- This means that custom blocks can be added.
- Client-side (cross browser support)
	- It runs purely in client-side JavaScript so will run in (almost) any browser.
- Debugging
	- Unlike Scratch it allows for step-by-step debugging.

**Applications using Blockly**

*Code.org and Hour of Code*

Code.org is a non-profit organisation (and website) that aims to teach computer science. The website contains free coding lessons which use a number of high profile brands such as Star Wars and Angry Birds.

*Scratch Blocks!*

Scratch Blocks is a partnership between [Scratch and Google Blockly](https://scratch.mit.edu/developers) with the aim of developing "a new generation of graphical programming blocks". This was only released in 2016 and may be worthy of it's own article soon!
