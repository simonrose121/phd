Wider reading around how children think and learn will hopefully help me write a valuable and informed review of current literature. It may should also help cement what I want to focus on for my PhD.

**Learning mathematics**
- Research surrounding working memory and cognitive risk.

**Algorithmic thinking**
- Linking it to mathematical thinking

**Educational models for children's learning**

**Logo**
- Discovery learning

**Analogical reasoning**
- Cognitive development
