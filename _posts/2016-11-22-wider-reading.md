Doing some wider reading around how children think and learn will hopefully help me write a valuable and informed review of current literature. It may should also help clarify a focus for my PhD.

### Analogical reasoning

Analogoical reasoning is a type of inductive reasoning that relies on an analogy. An analogy is a comparison between two objects or systems of objects that highlights respects in which they are similar. "Analogy is a conceptual strategy enabling children to make inferences about novel phenomena, to transfer learning across contexts, and to extract relevant information from everyday learning experiences on the basis of relational similarity" (Richland, Morrison and Holyoak 2006).

It is suggested that analogical reasoning contains 6 steps (2 of which are *optional*):

- Encoding
	- Storing possibly relevant attributes and values of the analogy in working memory.
- Inference
	- Discovering the relation between the terms of the analogy (parts A and B) and storing them in working memory.
- *Mapping*
	- Linking the domain to the range by discovering the relation between A and C.
- Application
	- Applying the attibutes and values to decide which further object matches C.
- *Justification*
	- In a situation where two possible options are available, the child may justify their decision.
- Response
	- Communicating a response

The process relies on the child being able to hold part A of the analogy in working memory. If she has underdeveloped working memory, this may be difficult. Children answering quasi-analogies such as "a bird is to air, as a fish is to ____" showed no improvement as they got older. But did show an improvement in answering mathematical questions using normal analogies (Sternberg and Bifkin 1979). This improvement could be linked to Piaget's staged and the development of formal operations, which includes analogical reasoning skills. However, younger children with domain knowledge can also demonstrate analogical thinking (Goswami and Brown 1990). Clements suggests that young children tend to use association instead of mapping when given analogical problems to solve.

### Young children's learning of mathematics

Literature in this area covers ground in to teaching maths in a developmentally appropriate way, covering issues such as the limited working memory of young children. The UK national curriculum states that in KS1 children should be taught the following skills (bold are those that are directly relatable to programming):

*Year 1*

- Number
	- Counting (in multiples of 2, 5 and 10)
	- Reading & writing numbers
	- Using number lines
	- Addition and subtraction
		- **Read, write and intepret mathematical statements (+, -, =)**
		- Use number bonds (memorised addition sums)
		- Add and subtract one digit and two digit numbers to 20
		- Solve one step problems using concrete objects, pictorial representations and arrays
	- Multiplication and division
		- Solve one step problems using concrete objects, pictorial representations and arrays
	- Fractions
		- Two equal parts of shape, object or quantity
		- Four equal parts of shape, object or quantity
- Measurement
	- Lengths and heights
	- Mass and weight
	- Capacity and volume
	- Time
	- Coins
	- **Sequencing of events**
- Geometry
	- Recognise and name common 2D and 3D shapes
	- **Describe position, direction and movement (including whole, half, quarter and three-quarter turns)**

*Year 2*

- Number
	- Counting (in multiplies  of 2, 3, 5 from 0, and in tens from any number)
	- Place value of each digit in a two digit number
	- Estimate numbers using different representations
	- **Compare and order numbers (>, < and =)**
	- Read and write numbers to at least 100
	- Use place value and number facts to solve problems
	- Additional and subtraction
		- Using concrete objects and pictorial representations
		- Recall and use addition and subtraction
		- Add and subtract numbers mentally
		- Communtative addition and uncommuntative subtraction
		- Inverse relationship of addition and subtraction
	- Multiplication and division
		- Calculate multiplication and division using tables and use symbols (x, ÷, =)
		- Communtative multiplication and uncommuntative division
	- Fractions
		- Recognise and write fractions
- Measurement
	- Appropriate standard units
	- **Compare and sequence intervals of time**
	- Time of day
- Geometry
	- **Order and arrange combinations of mathematical objects in patterns and sequences**
	- **Use mathematical vocabulary to describe position, direction and movement**
- Statistics
	- Intepret simple charts

A paper written by Ginsburg and Amit (2008) describes an approach to teaching mathematics to young children (aged 3-6). There ethnographic study observes a teacher and describes the content and outcome of her lessons. The study describes the concept of mapping, which describes "the idea that the three-dimensional world can be projected onto and represented by a two-dimensional surface. In effect, children have to imagine that they are looking down at the world from above". This involves concepts of *abstraction* and *projection*, similar concepts which are found in the popular flash game Lightbot which aims to teach programming principles.

Limitations of working memory when learning mathematics have been studied by Passolunghi and Siegel (2001). They found evidence to suggest that children with limited working memory struggled when performing arithmetic problem solving excercises. This is due to their inability to retain numerical information in working memory. Other studies have suggested that the deficit is focused on a deficit in remembering numerical information, and not on working memory in general.

### Algorithmic thinking

The Oxford dictionary definition of an algorithm is "a process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations, especially by a computer." Despite being a concept linked primarily to computer science, Knuth (1985) argues that alrgorithmic thinking is also applicable to subjects such as mathematics.

Research by Futschek and Moschitz describes an approach to teaching algorithmic thinking skills to young children using a tangibles to virtual environment (Scratch) progression (2011). This focuses on developing abstract thinking skills that are also key to computational thinking (Wing 2006). They do this using kinesthetic elements of learning (touch, sight, hearing, feeling and smelling).

In the paper, they list some basic algorithmic concepts:

- Basic commands
- Sequence of commands
- Alternative of commands (if)
- Iteration of commands (loop)
- Abstraction command (procedures)

### Logo & Discovery Learning

Pea conducted research in 1985 focusing on whether Logo is effective for improving problem solving ability and programming knowledge in children. He found no difference in ability using a pretest-posttest design between children who had used Logo and those that hadn't. The paper goes on to state that "transfer of problem-solving strategies between dissimilar problems, or problems of different content, is notoriously difficult to achieve even for adults" (1985, p6). This is arguably similar to abstraction, which is a key tenet of computational thinking. Furthermore, Pea suggests children do not pre-plan Logo programs. Prefering to follow an arguable bricolage (bottom-up) approach.

Mayer uses previous studies with Logo to critique discovery-learning (2004). He suggests that pure discovery methods, where children are not given any help by the teacher, are ineffective and that instead we should be teaching using guided discovery. Therefore combining instructionist and constructivist approaches to give leaners appropriate freedom to find answers for themselves whilst being guided by the teacher. This approach was defined by Bruner as "Scaffolding". He goes on to reference Pea (and other researchers) who suggest that Logo is ineffective when used in a pure discovery environment.

However, there is contradicting research that suggests Logo does improve cognitive ability (Clements 1990). Clements focuses on using Logo to develop metacomponential ability, which are "executive processes that control the operation of the system as a whole and plan and evaluate all information processing" (1990, p141). Or the role in which learners cognitively monitor their own learning. He finds that third grade Logo users score significantly higher on these abilities after using Logo.

### Common Themes

- Working memory (can children hold sufficient information in their heads in order to solve problems?)
- Abstraction (establishing new levels of complexity than can be applied to multiple contexts)
