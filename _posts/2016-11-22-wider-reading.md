Wider reading around how children think and learn will hopefully help me write a valuable and informed review of current literature. It may should also help cement a focus for my PhD.

**Learning mathematics**

- Research surrounding working memory and cognitive risk.

**Algorithmic thinking**

- Linking it to mathematical thinking

**Logo**

- Discovery learning
- Related literature to teaching using the logo programming environment

**Analogical reasoning**

Analogoical reasoning is a type of inductive reasoning that relies on an analogy. An analogy is a comparison between two objects or systems of objects that highlights respects in which they are similar. "Analogy is a conceptual strategy enabling children to make inferences about novel phenomena, to transfer learning across contexts, and to extract relevant information from everyday learning experiences on the basis of relational similarity" (Richland, Morrison and Holyoak 2006).

It is suggested that analogical reasoning contains 6 steps (2 of which are *optional*):

- Encoding
	- Storing possibly relevant attributes and values of the analogy in working memory.
- Inference
	- Discovering the relation between the terms of the analogy (parts A and B) and storing them in working memory.
- *Mapping*
	- Linking the domain to the range by discovering the relation between A and C.
- Application
	- Applying the attibutes and values to decide which further object matches C.
- *Justification*
	- In a situation where two possible options are available, the child may justify their decision.
- Response
	- Communicating a response

The process relies on the child being able to hold part A of the analogy in working memory. If she has underdeveloped working memory, this may be difficult. Children answering quasi-analogies such as "a bird is to air, as a fish is to ____" showed no improvement as they got older. But did show an improvement in answering mathematical questions using normal analogies (Sternberg and Bifkin 1979). This improvement could be linked to Piaget's staged and the development of formal operations, such as analogical reasoning skills. However, younger children with domain knowledge can also demonstrate analogical thinking (Goswami and Brown 1990).
