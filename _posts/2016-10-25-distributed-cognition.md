Distributed cognition is the theory that cognition can be spread across objects, individuals, artifacts and tools. This is done to further thinking and distribute effort required to complete a task.

**Principle Elements**

- Material & environment
- Social group
- Throughout time

**Examples**

Edwin Hutchins highlighted two examples of how distributed cognition is used and where it can be improved.

- Airplane cockpit (where the cognition required to keep the plane in the air is spread across the pilot, co-pilot and the instruments).
- Ship navigation (similar distrubuted cognition).
