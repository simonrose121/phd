Having explored the area surrounding my research, it would be logical to write a literature review tying all the themes together. This could either be published as it's own paper or be part of an initial study.

This first step is to look at existing reviews of the area of computational thinking in education. The reviews largely focus on a) what is involved in computational thinking (core skills or competencies), b) how should we be teaching computational thinking in education.

**No Patterns in Pattern Recognition : A Systematic Literature Review. (2016)**

The review begins by highlighting the need to operationalise definitions and competencies for computational thinking. Using three "notable" reports on computational thinking (Barr & Stephenson, 2011, CSTA, 2011 and Barendsen & Stoker, 2013), the authors have created a diagram to show core computational thinking competencies at undergraduate and K-12 levels.

The authors aim is to show that pattern recognition should be including in these competencies. They found articles that suggest pattern recognition is a "foundation for other high level competencies". However, this result was only from two articles they found.

**A Framework for Computational Thinking Based on a Systematic Research Review (2016)**

This review by Kalelioglu, Gulbahar and Kukul aims to synthesise literature on computational thinking in order to create a framework containing the "notion, scope and elements of CT" (2016, p583). They start by creating a wordle using well-known definitions of CT, this shows that abstraction, problem solving and thinking are key words that authors use.

The searched for papers from six different databases and digital libraries (may be useful in future):
- Ebscohost
- ScienceDirect
- Web of Science
- Springer
- IEEE Digital Library
- ACM Digital Library

Common defined features that form the scope of CT:
- Abstraction
- Problem solving
- Algorithmic thinking
- Pattern recognition

They also found that most papers produced on computational thinking were idea papers, with no research design. Therefore they believe there is no in-depth research about the concept, and no accepted or well-known definition of CT that has been scientifically proven. They then question how to teach CT, stating that assessment is a key area and how we actually assess computational thinking ability?

Roadmap for computational thinking as a problem-solving process:
*Identify the problem*
- Abstraction
- Decomposition

*Gathering, representing and analysing data*
- Data collection
- Data analysis
- Pattern recognition
- Conceptualising
- Data representation

*Generate, select and plan solutions*
- Mathematical reasoning
- Building algorithms and procedures
- Parallelisation

*Implement solutions*
- Automation
- Modeling and simulations

*Assessing solutions and continue for improvement*
- Testing
- Debugging
- Generalisation

The idea of this framework is that it can be used to aid teaching and assessment of computational thinking. It is a representation of computational thinking as a problem solving process, in terms of computational tasks.

This framework is definitely of interest, the authors describe it as scalable, but can it be scaled down to meet the needs of younger children? And does current teaching of computational thinking fit the framework? The mention of problem-solving opens up the area of how children generally solve problems at a young age, crossing over with educational theorists like Piaget and Vygotksy.
