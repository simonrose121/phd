Having explored the area surrounding my research, it would be logical to write a literature review tying all the themes together. This could either be published as it's own paper or be part of an initial study.

This first step is to look at existing reviews of the area of computational thinking in education. The reviews largely focus on a) what is involved in computational thinking (core skills or competencies), b) how should we be teaching computational thinking in education.

### Reviews

**No Patterns in Pattern Recognition : A Systematic Literature Review. (2016) - Annwesa Dasgupta**

The review begins by highlighting the need to operationalise definitions and competencies for computational thinking. Using three "notable" reports on computational thinking (Barr & Stephenson, 2011, CSTA, 2011 and Barendsen & Stoker, 2013), the authors have created a diagram to show core computational thinking competencies at undergraduate and K-12 levels.

The authors aim is to show that pattern recognition should be including in these competencies. They found articles that suggest pattern recognition is a "foundation for other high level competencies". However, this result was only from two articles they found.

*Summary*

Computational thinking competencies should include pattern recognition.

**A Framework for Computational Thinking Based on a Systematic Research Review (2016) - Kalelioglu, Gulbahar & Kukul**

This review by Kalelioglu, Gulbahar and Kukul aims to synthesise literature on computational thinking in order to create a framework containing the "notion, scope and elements of CT" (2016, p583). They start by creating a wordle using well-known definitions of CT, this shows that abstraction, problem solving and thinking are key words that authors use.

The searched for papers from six different databases and digital libraries (may be useful in future):
- Ebscohost
- ScienceDirect
- Web of Science
- Springer
- IEEE Digital Library
- ACM Digital Library

Common defined features that form the scope of CT:
- Abstraction
- Problem solving
- Algorithmic thinking
- Pattern recognition

They also found that most papers produced on computational thinking were idea papers, with no research design. Therefore they believe there is no in-depth research about the concept, and no accepted or well-known definition of CT that has been scientifically proven. They then question how to teach CT, stating that assessment is a key area and how we actually assess computational thinking ability?

Roadmap for computational thinking as a problem-solving process:

*Identify the problem*
- Abstraction
- Decomposition

*Gathering, representing and analysing data*
- Data collection
- Data analysis
- Pattern recognition
- Conceptualising
- Data representation

*Generate, select and plan solutions*
- Mathematical reasoning
- Building algorithms and procedures
- Parallelisation

*Implement solutions*
- Automation
- Modeling and simulations

*Assessing solutions and continue for improvement*
- Testing
- Debugging
- Generalisation

The idea of this framework is that it can be used to aid teaching and assessment of computational thinking. It is a representation of computational thinking as a problem solving process, in terms of computational tasks.

This framework is definitely of interest, the authors describe it as scalable, but can it be scaled down to meet the needs of younger children? And does current teaching of computational thinking fit the framework? The mention of problem-solving opens up the area of how children generally solve problems at a young age, crossing over with educational theorists like Piaget and Vygotksy.

*Summary*

A framework that can be used to assess computational thinking as a problem-solving skill.

**Review on teaching and learning of computational thinking through programming: What is next for K-12? (2014) - Lye & Koh**

Lye & Koh begin their abstract by stating that there is a differentiation between programming and coding. Programming exposes students to computational thinking concepts which involve problem solving (linking in with Kalelioglu, Gulbahar & Kukul), whereas coding is the process of writing computer programs.

They selected 27 articles for their literature review, concentrating on computational thinking in K-12. They categorised the studies using Brennan and Resnick's computational concepts, practices and perspectives. Interestingly, they only found two studies on computational thinking in children under age 7. These were a study by Fessakis et al. (2013) on whether mathematical ability in young children could be developed using Logo, and Kazakoff and Bers (2012) study in to sequential thinking.

*Summary*

More research is needed in to computational practices and perspectives in the classroom (and in general in natural K-12 settings). Verbalising thought processes and using discovery based environments with correct scaffolding.

Computational thinking is a problem-solving skill that can be transferred to other domains.

**A review of models for introducing computational thinking, computer science and computing in K-12 education. (2016)**

Reviewing how different countries (10 in total) have introduced computer science in to K-12 curricula. Including subject content and how the content is being taught. Has computing been given it's own subject or is it combined with another discipline.

![Programming Education]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/programmingeducation.png)

*Summary*

Of the 10 countries reviewed, 7 countries have computers science in some form as compulsory in primary education. Only South Korea, England and Poland have computer science as it's own subject in primary education.

**Computing Education in K-12 Schools: A Review of the Literature (2015)**

The authors review 47 peer-reviewed articles. They analyse the papers for instructional methods and programming tools used in computing education.

They found 33 different programming tools used in these 47 papers.

Popular instructional methods included game design, and tangible construction kits or robotics. Problem - project based approaches are used where students implement their knowledge by solving a problem or creating a project. They suggest that remixing and modifying other projects can help deal with issues surrounding constructionist approaches.

*Summary*

Research in the field uses a lot of different programming tools and instructional approaches. Deciding on the best approach requires an analysis of the classroom environment and the learners.

### Summary

Current literature reviews in the area focus on the following aspects of computational thinking:

- Definitions of what it is and what it contains (its core competencies).
- Computational thinking as a problem solving process.
- Cross-domain transfer (application in other concepts other than computer science).
- Tools and instructional approaches.

As of yet, there is no literature review that focuses entirely on computational thinking and young learners. All of these reviews focus on K-12, which ranges from 4-6 to 17-19. The lack of studies in this area is highlighted by reviews above, despite some countries beginning to teach computational thinking skills to children as young as 4 years old. This justifies a need for a literature review (stand alone or part of a larger study) that summarises papers in the area and justifies a need for more studies (and the specific nature of these).
