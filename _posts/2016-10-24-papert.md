"Tell me, and I will forget.
Show me, and I may remember.
Involve me, and I will understand"  
Confucius, 450bc

**Constructionism**

Papert's theory of constructionism is derived from Paiget's theory of constructivism, the difference being that it applies constructivist principles as a manor of learning. It is defined as "learning by making, inventing, doing and creating".

*Student centered*

- Knowledge is constructed by the learner.
- The teacher is a co-learner (the learner is the center of attention).
- There is no set destination, learning is open ended.
- Bricolage approach (learning by tinkering).

*Learning theory*

- Construcitonism is a learning theory, not a teaching theory.

**Instructionism**

Papert contrasted constructionism with instructionism. Instructionism is a learning theory that states learning is the direct result of being taught. It is is explicitly teaching facts or showing students how to solve problems and then having the students practice them.
