Seymour Papert

"Tell me, and I will forget.
Show me, and I may remember.
Involve me, and I will understand"
- Confucius, 450bc

**Constructionism**

Papert's theory of constructionism is derived from Paiget's theory of constructivism, the difference being that it applies constructivist principles as a manor of learning. It is defined as "learning by making, inventing, doing and creating".

*Student centered*

- Knowledge is constructed by the learner (inquiry learning).
- The teacher is a co-learner (the learner is the center of attention).
- There is no set destination, learning is open ended.
- Learning is individual.
- Bricolage approach (learning by tinkering).
- People learn best when learning is important to them (contextualised learning).

*Collaborative*

- Construcitonism is a learning theory, not a teaching theory.
- Social dimension to learning (Vygotsky).

*Logo*

Papert developed the computer software Logo, in which the learner provides commands that are then performed by an on screen turtle. This is the embodiment of constructionist learning.

**Constructionism vs Instructionism**

Papert contrasted constructionism with instructionism. Instructionism is a learning theory that states learning is the direct result of being taught. It is is explicitly teaching facts or showing students how to solve problems and then having the students practice them.
