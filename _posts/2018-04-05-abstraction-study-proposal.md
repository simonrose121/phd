Y6 pupils, mostly 11 years old.

**Pre-test** (w/c 21st May)

The pre-test aims to evaluate abstraction skills in Scratch and more generally in computational thinking.

*Scratch assessment*

*Computational thinking assessment*

**Intervention** (w/c 4th June - 13th July)

Participants will be split into three groups:

1. Pirate Plunder - debugging (existing program instructions)
2. Pirate Plunder - no debugging (empty programs)
3. Scratch curriculum - control

Note: The school have asked for class groups to be maintained. So the Pirate Plunder versions will be randomised within two classes and the third class will be the control.

The intervention will last a maximum of 6 weeks and take place during their timetabled IT slot. Y6 are given a morning in the IT suite that is divided into two 50 minute slots and 1 hour slot.

**Post-test** (w/c 16th July)

*Scratch assessment*

*Computational thinking assessment*

*Artifact-based interviews*
