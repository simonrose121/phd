Stagecast Creator is a visual programming environment designed to develop games. It aims to bridge the gap between what novice programmers want to program, and what they can program (what they call the "Gulf of execution").

**Key Features**

- Character creation
	- Stagecast creator allows users to create and import sprites using a bitmap graphic creator.
- Rules
	- Users code games by giving rules to characters.
	- For example, a user might program a bird to move up and down with the up or down arrow keys are pressed.
	- The rule creator dialog shows a before and after of what happens when that rule is triggered.
- Programming by demonstration (PBD)
	- This concept is called programming by demonstration.
	- Eliminates need for programming syntax.
	- Complex behaviours can be programmed in a simple fashion.
	- Programming concepts
		- Variables
		- Iteration
		- Conditionals
		- Sub-routines
