**Vygotsky's 6 Major Assumptions**

1. Adults convey to children a cutural interpretation of the world.
2. Thought and language are interdependant.
3. Complex mental processes are developed through social activities.
4. Children can only complete challenging tasks with assistance from a more competant other.
5. Completing challenging tasks causes cognitive growth.
6. Play stretches cognitive function in children.

**Elementary Mental Functions**

Children begin life with 4 elementary mental functions:

- Memory
- Attention
- Sensation
- Perception

**Social Interaction & Cognitive Development**

Children go through several stages of speech development:

*0- Preintellectual speech*

Babbling, laughing, crying and gesturing.

*1- Autonomous speech*

The child attaches invented words to objects/people.

*1.5- Naive psychology*

Referring to objects by name.
The child begins communicating using basic sentences.

*3-7 Communicative & ego-centric communication*

Communicative speech is communicating with others.
Ego-centric speech is communicating with ones self.

Ego-centric moves from speaking out loud (self-talk or to another individual)
through to inner speech as the children develops cognitively.

Inner speech is not fully functional until age 12. It represents the most
advanced level of the relationship between speech and thought.

**Zone of Proximal Development**

The zone of proximal development is the activities that a child can do with
the help of a more knowledgable other (MKO) that it would have otherwise
been unable to do.
