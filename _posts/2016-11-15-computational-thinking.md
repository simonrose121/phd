Before going any further, it is important to define what computational thinking actually is. It is loosely defined as "thinking like a computer", so is it a skill required only for programming? or does it transfer to other subject learning such as Science or Mathematics (STEM).

Computational thinking was first defined by Wing (2006) as "aspects of designing systems, solving problems and understanding human behaviours" that highlight contributions to computer science. This implies that although it is a skill closely related to computer programming, thinking computationally can be an important more general skill to develop in wider learning. That being said, there are also plenty of other definitions for computational thinking. For example, the International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE) views computational thinking as "algorithmic thinking with automation tools and data representation with the use of simulation".

Wing also states that computational thinking is "a universally applicable attitude and skill set everyone, not just computer scientists, would be eager to learn and use". She also suggests that it is at the core of all STEM disciplines.

There are several widely accepted elements that make up computational thinking (CT):

- Abstraction
- Pattern generalisation (models and simulations)
- Systematic processing of information
- Symbol systems and representations
- Algorithmic notions of flow of control (algorithms)
- Debugging
- Conditional logic
- Iterative, recursive and parallel thinking
- Modularisation

Brennan and Resnick categorised CT in to three different paradigms (using Scratch as the context).

- Computational Concepts (programming concepts learnt in Scratch)
	- Sequences
	- Loops
	- Data
	- Parallelism
	- Events
	- Conditionals
	- Operators
- Computational Practices
	- Incremental and iterative (design)
	- Testing and debugging
	- Reusing and remixing
	- Abstracting and modularising
- Computational Perspectives
	- Connecting (with peers)
	- Questioning (the world around them)
	- Expressing ("I can create")

Despite widespread literature suggesting that computational thinking should be an essential part of curricula, there are still some concerns surrounding it's introduction:

- Do all children need to learn computational competancy even if they have no interest in a career in STEM?
- Is there spaced in an already packed curriculum?
- Lack of clarity over what it is means there isn't a set way to teach it

Seiter and Foreman attempt to provide a framework, the Progression of Early Computational Thinking, for introducing computational thinking concepts to primary age students (2013). They highlight the limited formal research in to how computational thinking skills develop in primary age children, and focus on the need for formal assessment of computational thinking ability.  The framework has three seperate components of decreasing abstraction:

- Computational thinking concepts
	- Procedures and algorithms
	- Problem decomposition
	- Parallelisation and synchronisation
	- Abstraction
	- Data representation
- Design pattern variables (contextual proficiences based around common coding patterns in Scratch)
	- Animate looks
	- Animate motion
	- Conversate
	- Collide
	- Maintain score
	- User interaction
- Evidence variables (concrete, ranked characteristics of code written in Scratch)
	- Looks
	- Sound
	- Motion
	- Variables
	- Sequencing & Looping
	- Boolean Expressions
	- Operators
	- Conditionals
	- Coordination
	- UI Events
	- Parallelization
	- Initialisation of location and appearance

This framework is in many ways similar to that defined by Brennan and Resnick. The ideas of problem decomposition and abstraction are interesting due to evidence that younger children struggle with these principles. There is also a growing amount of literature relating to computational thinking  and its role in higher education (e.g. Weintrop et al 2016). Additional concerns may include the teaching of these complex principles to younger children. Are they developed enough to be able to articulate these skills? or does this not matter, as long as they can perform tasks that incorperate these skills in another context?

**Computational Thinking & Problem Solving**

Problem solving is the ability to find solutions to problems in an orderly manor. As a skill it can be applied to many subjects including mathematics, science and engineering. Computational thinking can be described as a "problem solving tool" as it enables people to approach problems logically.
