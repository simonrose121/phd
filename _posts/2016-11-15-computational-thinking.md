Before going any further, it is important to define what computaitonal thinking actually is. Is it a skill required for programming? or does it transfer to other subject learning such as Science or Mathematics.

Computational thinking was first defined by Wing as "aspects of designing systems, solving problems and understanding human behaviours" that highlight contributions to computer science. This implies that it is a skill closely related to computer programming.
