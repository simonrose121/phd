Before going any further, it is important to define what computational thinking actually is. Is it a skill required only for programming? or does it transfer to other subject learning such as Science or Mathematics (STEM).

Computational thinking was first defined by Wing (2006) as "aspects of designing systems, solving problems and understanding human behaviours" that highlight contributions to computer science. This implies that although it is a skill closely related to computer programming, thinking computationally (or like a computer) can be an important more general skill to develop in wider learning.

Wing goes on to state that computational thinking is "a universally applicable attitude and skill set everyone, not just computer scientists, would be eager to learn and use". She also suggests that it is at the core of all STEM disciplines.

These are the widely accepted elements of computational thinking:

- Abstraction
- Pattern generalisation (models and simulations)
- Systematic processing of information
- Symbol systems and representations
- Algorithmic notions of flow of control (algorithms)
- Debugging
- Conditional logic
- Iterative, recursive and parallel thinking
- Modularisation

Concerns with the integration of CT in to educational curricula:

- Do all children need to learn computational competancy even if they have no interest in a career in STEM?
- Is there spaced in an already packed curriculum?
- Lack of clarity over what it is means there isn't a set way to teach it
