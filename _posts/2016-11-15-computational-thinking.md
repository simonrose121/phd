Before going any further, it is important to define what computational thinking actually is. Is it a skill required for programming? or does it transfer to other subject learning such as Science or Mathematics (STEM).

Computational thinking was first defined by Wing (2006) as "aspects of designing systems, solving problems and understanding human behaviours" that highlight contributions to computer science. This implies that although it is a skill closely related to computer programming, thinking computationally (or like a computer) can be an important more general skill to develop in wider learning.
