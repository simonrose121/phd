This article is a draft of the research design for the preliminary study mentioned in the [last article]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2016-12-13-preliminary-study %}). It will be split into the same structure as the final research design document, which will be used when planning and eventually writing up the study.

## Research Question

Previous research has found that developmentally appropriate robotics programming can have a positive impact on sequential thinking ability in young children (Kazakoff & Bers, 2011; Kazakoff et al., 2013). The sequential nature of programming games indicates they may improve sequential thinking. It would be interesting to see if the improvement in sequencing ability can be replicated using a programming game compared to a control group. The research question is as follows:

Can programming games be used to develop sequential thinking ability in young children?

## Hypothesis
*Proposed outcomes of the research*

The proposed hypotheses for the research are as follows:

- Programming games will improve the sequential thinking ability of young children.
- Programming games will provide a transfer of knowledge to sequencing ability in other problem-solving contexts.

## Data Collection
- *Participants*
- *Methods of data collection? (pre-test post-test)*
- *Primary or secondary data?*

The study will follow a quasi-experimental pre-test post-test design. The participants will be Y1 children (aged 5 and 6). A sequential mixed-methods approach will be used. Quantitative data will be collected using a sequencing assessment. Participants will be asked to order 4 pictures representing stages of a known event, e.g. a flower growing. This type of assessment was first used by Baron-Cohen, Leslie, & Frith (1986). The participants will be split in to two groups; one will play Lightbot Jr, and the other will play a side scrolling game that does not employ sequencing. Participants will play the game for half an hour a day for a week, and then complete a post-test of a different story sequence. Qualitative data will be collected through observations whilst the intervention is taking place.

**Notes**

Schools are already teaching sequencing as computational thinking, so it would be good to have a scientific study to back up this logic! Or does it dramatically reduce the chance of getting good results?

## Potential Limitations
- *Practical limitations of the study*

The existing computational thinking ability of the participants may affect the study. If they have already developed sequential thinking skills, the intervention may show no difference between the pre and post tests. This is particularly relevant as schools have been instructed to teach computational thinking to Y1 children using picture sequences, and combine this with beebots  (Bush & Harris, 2014).

Further limitations will include the amount of time the participants can spend playing the games, as it will need to be fitted in to the curriculum. A possible method is after school clubs, although this will result in lower participant numbers.
