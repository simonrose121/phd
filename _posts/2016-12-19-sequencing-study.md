This article is a page of notes that will help me write the research design for the preliminary study mentioned in the [last article]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2016-12-13-preliminary-study %}). It will be split into the same structure as the final research design document, which will be used when planning and eventually writing up the study.

## Research Question

Previous research has found that developmentally appropriate robotics programming can have a positive impact on sequential thinking ability in young children (Kazakoff & Bers, 2011; Kazakoff et al., 2013). The sequential nature of programming games indicates they may improve sequential thinking. It would be interesting to see if the improvement in sequencing ability can be replicated using a programming game. The research question is as follows:

Do programming games (such as Lightbot) have an effect on sequencing ability in young children?

## Hypothesis
*Proposed outcomes of the research*

- Programming games will improve the sequential thinking ability of young children.
- Programming games will provide a transfer of knowledge to sequencing ability in other problem-solving contexts.

## Data Collection
- *Methods of data collection? (pre-test post-test)*
- *Primary or secondary data?*

The study will follow a quasi-experimental pre-test post-test design. Quantitative data will be collected using a sequencing assessment.

## Potential Limitations
- *Practical limitations of the study*

The existing computational thinking ability of the participants may affect the study. If they have already developed sequential thinking skills, the intervention may show no effect between the pre and post tests.
