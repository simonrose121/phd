This article is a draft of the research design for the preliminary study mentioned in the [last article]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2016-12-13-preliminary-study %}). It will be split into the same structure as the final research design document, which will be used when planning and eventually writing up the study.

## Research Question

Previous research has found that developmentally appropriate robotics programming can have a positive impact on sequential thinking ability in young children (Kazakoff & Bers, 2011; Kazakoff et al., 2013). The sequential nature of programming games indicates they may improve sequential thinking. It would be interesting to see if the improvement in sequencing ability can be replicated using a programming game compared to a control group. The research question is as follows:

Do programming games (such as Lightbot) have an effect on sequencing ability in young children?

## Hypothesis
*Proposed outcomes of the research*

The proposed hypotheses for the research are as follows:

- Programming games will improve the sequential thinking ability of young children.
- Programming games will provide a transfer of knowledge to sequencing ability in other problem-solving contexts.

## Data Collection
- *Participants*
- *Methods of data collection? (pre-test post-test)*
- *Primary or secondary data?*

The study will follow a quasi-experimental pre-test post-test design. The participants will be Y1 children (aged 5 and 6). Quantitative data will be collected using a sequencing assessment. Participants will be asked to order 4 pictures of stages of known events, for example watching a flower grow. A similar assessment to that used by Baron-Cohen, Leslie, & Frith (1986). Sequencing is a key part of computational thinking, and similar sequencing tasks are used to teach these concepts in English primary schools (Bush & Harris, 2014). Qualitative data will be collected through observations whilst the intervention is taking place.

The participants will be split in to two groups; one that will play Lightbot Jr, and one that will play a side scrolling game that does not require sequential thinking. Participants will play the game for half an hour a day for a week, and then complete a post-test of a different story sequence.

**Notes**

Schools are already teaching sequencing as computational thinking, so it would be good to have a scientific study to back up this logic! Or does it dramatically reduce the chance of getting good results?

## Potential Limitations
- *Practical limitations of the study*

The existing computational thinking ability of the participants may affect the study. If they have already developed sequential thinking skills, the intervention may show no difference between the pre and post tests. This is particularly relevant as schools have been instructed to teach computational thinking to Y1 using picture sequences, and combine this with bee-bots. It is therefore important that the selected school has not yet taught these principles.
