Jean Piaget was a developmental psychologist that theorised that children go through several stages of cognitive development. This has to do with how they link their thought processes to their environments. He defined these stages with ages attached but these have been disputed as cognitive development is a more fluid process.

**Schemas**

Piaget defined schemas as basic building blocks of cognitive models. Which help us form a representation of the world around us.

**Understanding new information**

*Assimilation*
Using an existing schema to deal with a new object or situation.

*Accommodation*
Altering an existing schema to fit a new object or situation that doesn't quite fit.

*Equilibrium*
A child's existing schemas can be used to process new information.

*Disequilibrium*
New information cannot be fitted in to current schemas.

**Developmental Stages**

**Sensorimotor** (0-2)

- Gathering information using the senses (touching and eating anything they can get their hands on).
- Active with their bodies, figuring out what they can do.
- Developing object permenance, the idea that objects and people still exist even if they are out of sight.

**Preoperational** (2-7)

- Egocentric (difficult to imagine another persons point of view).
- Mental representation of objects and events.
- Pretend play using imagination.
- Animism (inanimate objects have feelings).
- Centration (concentrate on one aspect of a problem).
- Developing a theory of mind.

**Concrete operational** (7-11)

- Decentration (can think logically about all aspects of a problem).
- Conservation principle.

**Formal operational** (12+)

- Abstract and moral reasoning.

***Critisms of Piaget's theory***

- Role in which language plays, implicit meaning given from questions that don't make logical sense to the child.
- Piaget's problems (conservation for example) don't make sense to the child, when given context as to why they are performed the child is more likely to get the correct answer.
