Jean Piaget was a developmental psychologist that theorised that children go through several stages of cognitive development. This has to do with how they link their thought processes to their environments. He defined these stages with ages attached but these have been disputed as cognitive development is a more fluid process.

**Sensorimotor** (0-2)

- Gathering information using the senses (touching and eating anything they can get their hands on).
- Active with their bodies, figuring out what they can do.
- Developing object permenance, the idea that objects and people still exist even if they are out of sight.

**Preoperational** (2-7)

- Egocentric (difficult to imagine another persons point of view).
- Mental representation of objects and events.
- Pretend play using imagination.
- Animism (inanimate objects have feelings).
- Centration (concentrate on one aspect of a problem).
- Developing a theory of mind.

**Concrete operational** (7-11)

- Decentration (can think logically about all aspects of a problem).
- Conservation principle.
