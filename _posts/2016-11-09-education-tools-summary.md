I've tried to cover tools that are relevant to young children (5-7 years old) whilst analysing a variety of different types of environments (links can be found [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2016-10-31-programming-tools %})).

Below is a venn diagram that attempts to categorise these tools in to textual, visual and physical categories (*Games in white, more traditional programming environments in black.*)

Additionally, several other interesting aspects can be drawn from these tools... which may or may not be the subject of some future research:

- Constructionism vs instructionism
- Problem based learning, game based learning and design based learning.
- Rule based (declarative programming) compared to imperative programming languages taught on CS courses.
- Linking code to a character or placing it in a single programming space.
- Sequential vs concurrent (general idea about teaching complex programming principles in a diguised way).
- Programming by demonstration (PBD)
- Teacher content (lesson plans, how it fits with curriculums, etc).
- *Appropriateness for younger children? How can you say?*
