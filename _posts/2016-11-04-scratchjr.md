![ScratchJr Environment]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/scratchjr.png){:width="500px"}

ScratchJr is designed for children 5-7 years old. It simplifies Scratch's concepts to produce a block-based environment that is easier to use for children of this age range. It's conception was based on research that Scratch is not suitible for children aged below 8 years old.

**Based On**

*Scratch*

**Key Features**

- Block-based programming without text
	- Research suggests that some children under the age of 8 struggle to acquire the common vocabulary used in Scratch. Blocks in Scratch are completely icon based.
	- Blocks are arranged from left to right instead of top to bottom.
	- Blocks are squarer than those in Scratch.
	- Categories are simpler:
		- Triggering
		- Motion
		- Looks
		- Sounds
		- Control
		- Endings
- Coding in sprites
	- Children create code in sprites (so behaviour is individual to these characters).
	- Messages can be used to trigger actions in other sprites.
- Immediate (and slower) feedback
	- Blocks must be in the scripting space to be active.
	- When clicked the feedback is slow enough to be visible (and the current block is active).
- Grid (removing cartesian coordinates)
	- Scratch's coordinate system is too complicated for children of this age group.
	- ScratchJr uses a simplified coordinate system that is easier to understand.
- Minimising mouse movement, clicking and scrolling
	- All items are close together with the aim of minimising movement to be performed.
- Pages
	- There is a limit of 4 pages on ScratchJr so users can create basic stories.

**Use in Education**

- Can be used to meet objectives of the KS1 curriculum which is:
	- Pupils should be taught to:
		- understand what algorithms are; how they are implemented as programs on digital
	devices; and that programs execute by following precise and unambiguous instructions
		- create and debug simple programs
		- use logical reasoning to predict the behaviour of simple programs
		- use technology purposefully to create, organise, store, manipulate and retrieve digital
	content
		- recognise common uses of information technology beyond school
		- use technology safely and respectfully, keeping personal information private; identify
	where to go for help and support when they have concerns about content or contact on
	the internet or other online technologies.
