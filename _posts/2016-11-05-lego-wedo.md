Lego Mindstorms is a series of construction kits that contain both hardware and software to create customizable, programmable robots. It's name comes from Seymour Papert's [Mindstorms]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2016-10-18-mindstorms %})) book.

It's high level of complexity lends it to teaching complex computer science concepts, so we'll concentrate more on Lego WeDo 2.0.
