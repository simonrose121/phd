Jerome Bruner's constructivist theory of learning says that the aim of education should be autonomy, learning to learn.

His theory differs from Piaget's in that learning does not happen in stages, but is a continual process that uses three modes of knowledge representation. Although Bruner did define age ranges in which they developed.

**Enactive** (0-1)

- Action based information that gets stored in memory (muscle memory).
- Past events are represented through motor responses.
- Object permenance has often not yet been developed.

**Iconic** (1-6)

- Information is stored as images (mental picture).

**Symbolic** (7+)

- Information is stored as language.
- Symbols are flexible (can be ordered, sorted and modified).

Bruner suggests that when faced with new material it is best to follow this progression.

**Scaffolding**

He also uses the idea for *scaffolding* Similar to Vygotsky's zone of proximal development. In which a more knowledgable other helps a learner to achive a specific goal. He opposed Piaget's notion of readiness, and suggested that children could learn any information that was taught correctly, despite their age.

**Spiral Curriculum**

Ideas are taught initially at a simple level, then re-visited later on with more complex content in gradually increasing difficulty.
